{"documentation":"\n  The sockets package allows you to open TCP sockets to servers or to create a TCP server socket\n  yourself.\n\n  The following is a very basic example of opening a TCP socket to make an HTTP request and print\n  the first 140 characters of the response.\n  ```\n  🍦 socket 🍺 🔷📞🆕 🔤www.emojicode.org🔤 🔤80🔤\n  💬 socket 📇 🔤GET \/ HTTP\/1.1❌r❌nHost: www.emojicode.org❌r❌n❌r❌n🔤\n\n  🍦 data 🍺 👂 socket 140\n  😀 🍺 🔡 data\n  ```\n\n  At the time of writing this, the above code would return something similar to:\n  ```\n  HTTP\/1.1 200 OK\n  Server: GitHub.com\n  Content-Type: text\/html; charset=utf-8\n  Last-Modified: Sat, 29 Oct 2016 11:54:03 GMT\n  Access-Control-Al\n  ```\n\n  Here we’ve an example of a minimal echo-server that listens on port 8728. The server simply sends\n  back a copy of the data it received.\n  ```\n  🍦 server 🍺 🔷🏄🆕 8728\n\n  🔁 👍 🍇\n    🍦 clientSocket 🍺 🙋 server\n    🔁 👍 🍇\n      🍦 readData 👂 clientSocket 50\n      🍊🍦 data readData 🍇\n        💬 clientSocket data\n      🍉\n    🍉\n  🍉\n  ```\n  Of course, the code above is very minimal and incomplete. For example, it can handle only one\n  connection.\n","valueTypes":[],"classes":[{"name": "🏄","genericArguments":[],"documentation":"\n  🏄 represents a socket that listens for clients on a given port.\n","methods":[{"name":"🙋","access":"🔓","returnType":{"package":"sockets","name":"📞","optional":true},"genericArguments":[],"documentation":"\n    Waits until a client wants to connect to this socket and returns a socket\n    to communicate with it.\n  ","arguments":[]}],"initializers":[{"name":"🆕","access":"🔓","canReturnNothingness":true,"genericArguments":[],"documentation":"\n    Creates a 🏄 instance that immediately starts listening on the given port.\n    This initializer returns Nothingness if the socket can’t be bound to the\n    given port.\n  ","arguments":[{"type":{"package":"s","name":"🚂","optional":false},"name":"port"}]}],"classMethods":[],"conformsTo":[]},{"name": "📞","genericArguments":[],"documentation":" 📞 represents a socket for communication between client and server.
