## Installing

1.
  Download the SDK for your system.
  Run the `install.sh` script with root privileges. For instance:

    sudo ./install.sh
2.
  Probably your system is not yet ready to display emojis. While Mac OS X is, you will likely have to install
  the `ttf-ancient-fonts` on Linux.

    sudo apt-get install ttf-ancient-fonts
