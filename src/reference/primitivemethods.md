# Primitive Methods

You can call methods on primitives. These are called like normal methods. In comparison with normal methods they have the advantage that they are compiled to own instructions which makes them a lot faster than normal methods.

Due to the fact that mathematical operations are performed using *operators* in other languages, primitive methods are sometimes mistakenly called operators.

The advantage of not having operators is that every class can easily
