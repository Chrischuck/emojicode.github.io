# Enums

## Defining an Enum

To define an enum you use 🦃. For example this defines an enum named 📜 which
has the values 🌭, 🍕 and 🍔.

```
🦃 📜 🍇
  🌭
  🍕
  🍔
🍉
```

## Instantiating an Enum

Enums are instantiated by 🔷:

```
🔷📜🍕
```

## Type compatibility

All enum types are compatible to 🚂 because at runtime the enum values will be
represented by 🚂. This of course means that you cannot cast to an enum at
runtime.
